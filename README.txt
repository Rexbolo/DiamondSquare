This is a python implementation of the classic diamond-square algorithm for 2-D height maps,
which are often used for terrain creation. It should be easy to understand if you read through
the file, and implentation should involve importing the file, and running diamond_square(...) 
to recieve a numpy array, or python list, with the desired heightmap.

Feel free to post questions or requests, and I'll see what I can do.

If you use it in something, I'd love to hear about it. 

Best,
